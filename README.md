# Welcome to Stormsong Valley
As my learning journey continues, I started learning about Sass and how powerful it can be.
Instead of making an ugly demo page and copying what I'm seeing on the video, I decided to make my learning experince more fun, and design my own project!
So I opened Figma and designed this simple website about **Stormsong Valley** which is a place from the video game **World of Warcraft**.
_If you didn't figure by my username I'm a WoW player_

It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing. So, if you got any feedback/suggestions about my code, please feel free to contact me and help me be a better developer!

Anyway, That's all, See you next time! :smile:
