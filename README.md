# Welcome to Stormsong Valley!
As my learning journey continues, I started learning about Sass and how powerful it can be. <br>
After watching a batch of videos, I decided to practice what I've learned. <br>
I had two options here. <br>
1. To follow along with a tutorial.
2. To go wild and create something from my head.

_Spoiler alert: I went with the second_ <br>
So I opened Figma and designed a simple website about Stormsong Valley (a place from World of Warcraft). <br>
I hope you'll enjoy this project as much as I did. You can view it [here](https://ohadosnat.github.io/stormsong-sass/dist/) <br>


It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing. <br>
**Any feedback, suggestions, tips on how to improve my code is more than welcome!** <br>

That's all for today! See you next time! <br>
