            <h2>Meet the Neighbors</h2>
            <p>
                The reception you’ll receive in Brennadam isn’t a warm one despite the beauty of the surrounding town.
                The citizens are angry at the soldiers for seizing their harvests and failing to protect the people they
                are meant to serve. Brother Pike will help find the answers you seek, but each discovery is another knot
                in a skein that wends through this troubled land. There is more beneath the surface to be discovered,
                and you sense darkness waiting just out of sight.
                <br><br>
                The further inland you go, the more apparent it becomes that the void’s corruption has burrowed deeply
                into the land, the wildlife, and its people. Those of able body (if not able mind) are either
                conscripted or manipulated into serving the tidesages and the malevolent will that commands them.

                <h2>Things to Try</h2>
                <p>A sip of <b>Seaglide Elixir</b> can be a great refreshment when battling void-corrupted creatures of
                    the
                    sea. It also gives you the ability to walk on water—for a little while. “It is said that tidesage
                    magic allows Kul Tiran ships to glide effortlessly through the sea.” Try not to touch too many
                    unfamiliar things unless you know what you’re getting into—though of course, the voices will insist
                    there's nothing to fear. The Whispering Wavestaff giveth and taketh. But then again, what’s a little
                    cost in health compared to laying out a little extra carnage?</p>

            <h2>Under the Siege</h2>
            <p>
                On the western coast, Fort Daelin is under siege by the naga. Brutes pummel the stone walls even as
                harpoons drive further into the walls above them. Without aid, the levee holding back the sea will
                plunge the fertile valley into the naga-infested depths.

            <h2>A Prickly Situation</h2>
            <p>
                Emboldened by the soldiers neglecting their duties, vicious creatures have encroached on the noble
                people of Stormsong. Whether it’s ettin in Millstone Hamlet or the territorial quilboar, these threats
                will only grow more aggressive without someone to push them back.

            <h2>Monsters of the Sea</h2>
            <p class="last-elem">
                On an island to the northeast resides the seat of power for both House Stormsong and the tidesages: the
                Shrine of the Storm. Its very foundations are carved into the rocky outcroppings, and the sign of the
                kraken adorns its ancient structures.
