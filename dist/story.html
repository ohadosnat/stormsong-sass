            <p>The lands of Stormsong Valley are lush with green grasses and rock-strewn rolling hills. <br>
                Wildlife and plant growth thrive here, fed by the inland streams and the invigorating sea air. It is a
                region made rich by the harmony between both land and sea.</p>

            <p>As with any great mystery, you’ll need to find and follow the clues before you. Begin by taking a ferry
                to the Stormsong Monastery located in Boralus. Perhaps the sisters and brothers there will have more
                insight on the missing fleet. Thankfully, you won’t be alone for your journey. A ward of Harbormaster
                Cyrus Crestfall, your guide Taelia is a knowledgeable companion eager to help you get to the bottom of
                things in Stormsong Valley.
                <br><br>
                The signs of the sea are everywhere in the monastery, but an itch between your shoulder blades feeds the
                impression that you’re unwelcome. Answers aren’t easy to come by and danger is lurking nearer than you
                think.
            </p>

                <p class="quote-text">The Kul Tiran fleet has been lost at sea. The tidesages of Stormsong may be our
                    only hope to locate the fleet of legend.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Word from someone within the resistance is that the fleet is not truly lost but trapped by dark forces.
                It will be up to you to find allies within Stormsong Valley to help you root out the heart of this
                conspiracy and bring the fleet home. Brother Pike from the town of Brennadam in the north is one such
                ally. You’ll need to meet with him to find out what more he knows of the challenges you’ll face.
                <br><br>
                The Highland Pass is the only land route into Stormsong Valley, but a blockade halts passage between
                Brennadam and the rest of Kul Tiras. Once you find a way through, you’ll crest the pass to take in the
                breathtaking sight of the land stretched out before you.</p>
